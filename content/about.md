## About {#about}

I am a PhD graduate from the [Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering - CMSE](https://cmse.msu.edu/) and the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.msu.edu/) at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/) advised by [Dr. Jose A. Perea](https://www.joperea.com/). I obtained this degree with my thesis [Applications of Persistent Cohomology to Dimensionality Reduction and Classification Problems](https://doi.org/doi:10.25335/6j3a-6v23). 

Before MSU, I completed my MSc in Mathematics at Los Andes University in Bogota, Colombia and my BSc in Mathematics with a minor in Economy from the same institution. My master's dissertation was advised by [Dr. Andr√©s Angel](https://academia.uniandes.edu.co/AcademyCv/ja.angel908) and [Dr. Jose A. Perea](https://www.joperea.com/).
